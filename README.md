# Photo-Sensor-Data-on-an-LCD-Display
This project involves using a photo sensor to read the ambient light level and displaying the corresponding message on a 16x2 LCD display. The light level is divided into five categories: "Dark", "Partially Dark", "Medium", "Partially Light", and "Fully Lit".

## Assumptions
It is assumed that the following hardware is used for this project:
+ Arduino Uno board
+ 16x2 LCD display connected to the Arduino board using pins 12, 11, 5, 4, 3, and 2
+ Photo sensor connected to the Arduino board through analog input A0
